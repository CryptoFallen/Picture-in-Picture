# Picture-in-Picture

Picture in Picture Project built with Vanilla JS by following the Zero To Mastery Course:(JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio). Utilising and working with Vanilla JavaScript to build a better understanding of JavaScript first without the need of utilising libraries and frameworks.

This project uses screen capture documentation from MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Capture_API/Using_Screen_Capture

Note: Testing on Google Browser works, however testing on Brave has not allowed this application to work.

This project can and will be better improved on in the future with other functions to come:

- Light & Dark Mode Toogle
